## Introduction
This document serves as the documentation for a project created on GitHub, utilizing NodeJs with TypeORM, MySQL, TypeScript, implementing Clean Architecture, and adhering to SOLID principles. 
The project aims to provide a well-structured and modularized codebase, making it easier to maintain, test, and extend the application.

## Technologies Used
- NodeJs
- TypeORM
- MySQL
- TypeScript
- Project Structure

The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which promotes the separation of concerns and the independence of layers. It consists of the following layers:

Domain Layer: This layer represents the core business logic of the application. It includes entities, value objects, and business rules. It should not depend on any external frameworks or libraries.

Use Case Layer: This layer contains application-specific use cases or interactors. It orchestrates the interaction between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer. Use cases are independent of any specific framework or technology.

Infrastructure Layer: This layer is responsible for implementing the details of infrastructure-related concerns such as databases, external services, and frameworks. It provides concrete implementations of interfaces defined in the domain and use case layers. TypeORM is used as the ORM library for data access, and repositories are utilized to interact with the MySQL database.

Presentation Layer (optional): This layer handles the user interface and input/output interactions. It can be implemented using any framework of choice.

Dependency Injection: Dependency injection is used to wire the different layers together. Inversion of Control (IoC) containers like InversifyJS or Awilix can be used to manage dependencies.

## SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles guide the design and implementation of the project. These principles help in achieving loose coupling, high cohesion, and maintainability of the codebase. The following SOLID principles are followed:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or module should have only one reason to change.
- Open-Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. New functionality should be added by extending existing code rather than modifying it.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of having a large interface, smaller and more specific interfaces should be preferred.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
- Development Guidelines
  
To ensure consistency and maintainability, the following guidelines should be followed during development:

- Code should be organized into modules and directories based on their respective layers and responsibilities.
- Proper naming conventions should be followed for classes, methods, and variables, ensuring clarity and understanding.
- Unit tests should be written for all significant business logic and use cases. Test coverage should be maintained to ensure the correctness of the application.
- Error handling and validation should be implemented appropriately throughout the application.
- Logging and debugging capabilities should be included to aid in troubleshooting and monitoring.
- Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices can be adopted to automate the build and deployment process.

## Conclusion
By utilizing TypeORM, MySQL, TypeScript, Clean Architecture, and adhering to SOLID principles, this project aims to provide a structured, scalable, and maintainable codebase. It separates concerns, promotes code reusability, and 
enables easy testing and extensibility. Following the provided guidelines will ensure consistency and best practices throughout the development process.
